The paper "A Multilevel Active-Set Preconditioner for Box-Constrained Pressure Poisson Solvers" by Tetsuya Takahashi and Christopher Batty introduces a novel multilevel preconditioning scheme that efficiently solves large-scale box-constrained convex quadratic programs (QPs). This solution is particularly effective for pressure Poisson equations with non-negative pressure constraints in fluid animation, enhancing the realism and dynamism of fluid simulations.
